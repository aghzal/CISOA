        \ user or device to establish a nonremote connection with a system and simultaneously\
        \ communicate via some other connection to a resource in an external network.\
        \ This method of network access enables a user to access remote devices and\
        \ simultaneously, access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling might be desirable\
        \ by remote users to communicate with local system resources, such as printers\

        \ connections, making the system vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration\
        \ of organizational information. Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling\
        \ configuration settings that allow such capability in remote devices and\
        \ by preventing those configuration settings from being configurable by users.\
        \ Prevention can also be achieved by the detection of split tunneling (or\
        \ of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device,\
        \ and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling.\

        \ documentation describes how system-specific and hybrid controls are implemented\
        \ and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of the system.\
        \ System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and development\
        \ of systems in support of life cycle-based security and privacy engineering\
        \ processes. System security and privacy plans are living documents that are\
        \ updated and adapted throughout the system development life cycle (e.g.,\
        \ during capability determination, analysis of alternatives, requests for\
        \ proposal, and design reviews).  The CJISSECPOL describes the different types\
        \ of requirements that are relevant to organizations during the system development\
        \ life cycle and the relationship between requirements and controls. \nOrganizations\
        \ may develop a single, integrated security and privacy plan or maintain separate\
        \ plans. Security and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements\
        \ to a set of controls and control enhancements. The plans describe how the\
        \ controls and control enhancements meet the security and privacy requirements\
        \ but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the design or implementation\
        \ of the controls and control enhancements. Security and privacy plans contain\
        \ sufficient information (including specifications of control parameter values\
        \ for selection and assignment operations explicitly or by reference) to enable\
        \ a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent\
        \ of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations\
        \ and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan\
        \ is implemented. \nSecurity and privacy plans need not be single documents.\
        \ The plans can be a collection of various documents, including documents\
        \ that already exist. Effective security and privacy plans make extensive\
        \ use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents, including\
        \ design and implementation specifications where more detailed information\
        \ can be obtained. The use of references helps reduce the documentation associated\
        \ with security and privacy programs and maintains the security- and privacy-related\
        \ information in other established management and operational areas, including\
        \ enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering,\
        \ and acquisition. Security and privacy plans need not contain detailed contingency\

        \ guidance on the use of security architectures as part of the system development\
        \ life cycle process.  Security and privacy architectures are reviewed and\
        \ updated throughout the system development life cycle, from analysis of alternatives\
        \ through review of the proposed architecture in the RFP responses to the\

        \ services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security\

        \ and maintaining under configuration control a baseline configuration for\

        \ architectures. The development of the architectures is coordinated with\
        \ the senior agency information security officer and the senior agency official\
        \ for privacy to ensure that the controls needed to support security and privacy\
        \ requirements are identified and effectively implemented. In many circumstances,\
        \ there may be no distinction between the security and privacy architecture\
        \ for a system. In other circumstances, security objectives may be adequately\
        \ satisfied, but privacy objectives may only be partially satisfied by the\
        \ security requirements. In these cases, consideration of the privacy requirements\
        \ needed to achieve satisfaction will result in a distinct privacy architecture.\
        \ The documentation, however, may simply reflect the combined architectures.\

        such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors),\
        \ networked printers, scanners, and copiers\u2014are not overlooked. The capability\
        \ to readily update vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities\
        \ are discovered and announced and as new scanning methods are developed helps\
        \ to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by employed vulnerability\
        \ monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps\
        \ to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and\
        \ addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses\
        \ for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static analysis,\
        \ dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches.\
        \ Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and\
        \ in a variety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static\
        \ analysis tools, and binary analyzers. \nVulnerability monitoring includes\
        \ scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and\
        \ services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning\
        \ for flow control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating\
        \ incorrectly. Vulnerability monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability\
        \ monitoring tools that use instrumentation to continuously analyze components.\
        \ Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and may be run throughout\
        \ an organization without scanning. \nVulnerability monitoring tools that\
        \ facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated\
        \ Protocol (SCAP)-validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools\
        \ that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\
        \ (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment\
        \ Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for\
        \ vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\
        \ listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments,\
        \ such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities\
        \ for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that\
        \ express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System\
        \ (CVSS). \nVulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving\
        \ reports of security vulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability\
        \ disclosure programs can be as simple as publishing a monitored email address\
        \ or web form that can receive reports, including notification authorizing\
        \ good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations\
        \ generally expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization\
        \ and can use public vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood\
        \ that discovered vulnerabilities are reported directly to the organization\
        \ for remediation. \nOrganizations may also employ the use of financial incentives\
        \ (also known as \u201Cbug bounties\u201D) to further encourage external security\
        \ researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs can\
        \ be tailored to the organization\u2019s needs. Bounties can be operated indefinitely\
        \ or over a defined period of time and can be offered to the general public\
        \ or to a curated group.  Organizations may run public and private bounties\

      description: "Discussion: Not all system components, functions, or services\
        \ necessarily require significant protections. For example, criticality analysis\
        \ is a key tenet of supply chain risk management and informs the prioritization\
        \ of protection activities. The identification of critical system components\
        \ and functions considers applicable laws, executive orders, regulations,\
        \ directives, policies, standards, system functionality requirements, system\
        \ and component interfaces, and system and component dependencies. Systems\
        \ engineers conduct a functional decomposition \nof a system to identify mission-critical\
        \ functions and components. The functional decomposition includes the identification\
        \ of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the\
        \ specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware,\
        \ software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including\
        \ when the functions are shared by many components within and external to\
        \ the system. \nThe operational environment of a system or a system component\
        \ may impact the criticality, including the connections to and dependencies\
        \ on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of- systems, and outsourced IT\
        \ services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical system\
        \ components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities\
        \ that such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed\
        \ in terms of the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational\
        \ missions that are supported by the system that contains the components and\
        \ functions. \nCriticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design\
        \ is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If such analysis is performed\
        \ early in the system development life cycle, organizations may be able to\
        \ modify the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components\
        \ and functions, such as by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the\
        \ system design. Criticality analysis can also influence the protection measures\
        \ required by development contractors. In addition to criticality analysis\
        \ for systems, system components, and system services, criticality analysis\
        \ of information is an important consideration. Such analysis is conducted\
        \ as part of security categorization in RA-2. \nRelated Controls: CP-2, PL-2,\
