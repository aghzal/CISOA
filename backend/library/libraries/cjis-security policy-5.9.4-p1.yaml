        the controls in the AT family that are implemented within systems and organizations.
        The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies
        and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy
        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of awareness and training policy and procedures. Security
        and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are
        preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific
        policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general
        security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect
        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or

        role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in
        system security and

        privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate
        an update to

        awareness and training policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings,
        security

        incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives,

      description: 'Discussion: Organizations provide basic and advanced levels of
        literacy training to system users, including measures to test the knowledge
        level of users. Organizations determine the content of literacy training and
        awareness based on specific organizational requirements, the systems to which
        personnel have authorized access, and work environments (e.g., telework).
        The content includes an understanding of the need for security and privacy
        as well as actions by users to maintain security and personal privacy and
        to respond to suspected incidents. The content addresses the need for operations
        security and the handling of personally identifiable information. Awareness
        techniques include displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security
        and privacy reminders, displaying logon screen messages, generating email
        advisories or notices from organizational officials, and conducting awareness
        events. Literacy training after the initial training described in AT-2a.1
        is conducted at a minimum frequency consistent with applicable laws, directives,
        regulations, and policies. Subsequent literacy training may be satisfied by
        one or more short ad hoc sessions and include topical information on recent
        attack schemes, changes to organizational security and privacy policies, revised
        security and privacy expectations, or a subset of topics from the initial
        training. Updating literacy training and awareness content on a regular basis
        helps to ensure that the content remains relevant. Events that may precipitate
        an update to literacy training and awareness content include, but are not
        limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches,
        or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,
        policies, standards, and guidelines.

        The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies

        assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate
        on the development of incident response policy and procedures. Security and
        privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable,
        in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies
        and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security
        and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the
        complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one
        or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to incident
        response policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security
        incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations,

        the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security
        and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems,
        if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented
        and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.
        Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one

        logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event types
        include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems,
        security or privacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV
        credential usage, data action changes, query parameters, or external credential
        usage. In determining the set of event types that require logging, organizations
        consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the controls
        to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols
        that are operational and supported by the system.'

      description: To balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system
        needs, event logging requires identifying the subset of event types that are
        logged at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine
        that systems need the capability to log every file access successful and unsuccessful,
        but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to
        the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations
        desire to be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events
        is necessary to help ensure that the events remain relevant and continue to
        support the needs of the organization.

        programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures
        describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed

        such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, mission or business
        owner, senior agency information security officer, or senior agency official
        for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due
        to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary,
        and guest accounts. Where access involves personally identifiable information,
        security programs collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy
        to establish the specific conditions for group and role membership; specify
        authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations for
        each account; and create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance

        expiration dates or other factors that trigger the disabling of accounts.
        Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by

        required for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of

        consider system related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure

      description: 'Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use.
        Organizations establish temporary accounts as part of normal account activation
        procedures when there is a need for short- term accounts without the demand
        for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts
        in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation.
        Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization
        processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently
        used accounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when
        network resources are unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort).
        Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling
        or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include
        when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required
        and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group
        authenticators when members leave the group is intended to ensure that former
        group members do not retain access to the shared

        or group account. Some types of system accounts may require specialized training.

      description: 'Discussion: Information flow control regulates where information
        can travel within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed
        to access the information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that
        information. Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that
        claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information
        from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests
        that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information
        transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring
        information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how
        the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information between
        systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or
        privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more
        domain security or privacy policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards
        provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected
        systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions
        to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting
        information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only),
        verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security
        or privacy domain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce
        one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms
        to reassign security or privacy attributes and labels.Organizations commonly
        employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control
        the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within
        systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics
        of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example,
        in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration
        settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability
        based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based
        on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering
        and/or inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components)
        that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3
        through 32 primarily address cross- domain solution needs that focus on more
        advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement
        mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, such as high- assurance guards.
        Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf
        products. - Information flow enforcement also applies to control plane traffic
        (e.g., routing and DNS).

        regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network connection.
        Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by
        systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined,
        organization- defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations
        may employ different algorithms for different components of the system based
        on the capabilities of those components.

        Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating
        system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be
        taken when the number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded
        include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the
        username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities
        (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified Internet
        Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks,
        or applying user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device,
        or Media Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution
        of a delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective,
        organizations consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute
        force attacks.

        In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to respond to a secret
        question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is exceeded.
        Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally
        not permitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission

        (or processes acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external
        networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband,

        to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of

        effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic
        mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive
        orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still,
        VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not
        enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels
        can also affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic
        for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public
        web servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote
        access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without
        specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations

        form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is
        designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable
        or removable data storage; and includes a self contained power source. Mobile
        device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on
        board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in
        features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include
        smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single
        individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile
        device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems,
        depending on the nature and intendedpurpose of the device. Protection and
        control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to
        take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled
        areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical
        or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting
        information and systems. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different
        characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for
        the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific
        implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management,
        device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective
        software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software,
        scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating
        system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling
        unnecessary hardware. Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may
        vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize
        the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage
        restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device
        connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions
        before allowing mobile device connections to a system. Adequate security for
        mobile devices goes beyond the requirements specified in AC-19. Many safeguards
        for mobile devices are reflected in other controls. AC-20 addresses mobile
        devices that are not organization-controlled.
