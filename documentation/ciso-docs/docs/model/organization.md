# Organization

## A folder organization

[](#a-folder-organization)

For Access Control purpose, CISO Assistant data is organized in a tree of folders. Starting from a root folder called Global, it divide into subfolders called domains. The organization of the tree is not hardcoded, it is entirely determined by configuration. Any object in CISO Assistant is attached to a folder (including folders), either directly or indirectly through a parent object that is attached to a folder.

### So, what is a domain?

[](#so-what-is-a-domain)

A domain permits to organize your work depending on your use of CISO Assistant. For example, inside a company, you can create a domain for each department for which you need to carry out a variety of projects, or if you have different customers, you may as well have a domain for each one in order  **to delimit your work area** . Go to the [Domain](/o/HbfwRhJ3GSwl5w6MOhZw/s/UJGpmCYDFJNsz2CDasSm/model/organization/domain)page for more details.

## Projects

[](#projects)

Projects are fundamental context objects defined by the entity using CISO Assistant. They are grouped in domains. They will contain all your risk and compliance assessments. Apart from being able to group your various evaluations across the different domains, they have a very important role to play in piloting by breaking down the analytics to reduce noise. Go to the [Project](/o/HbfwRhJ3GSwl5w6MOhZw/s/UJGpmCYDFJNsz2CDasSm/model/organization/project) page for more details.

## User Groups

[](#user-groups)

User groups go hand in hand with domains. they associate permissions with users and define their scope, by being attached to a domain. They follow a simple and consistent RBAC model from a role containing permissions and a domain determining the perimeter. Go to the [User Groups](/o/HbfwRhJ3GSwl5w6MOhZw/s/UJGpmCYDFJNsz2CDasSm/model/organization/user-groups) page for more details.
